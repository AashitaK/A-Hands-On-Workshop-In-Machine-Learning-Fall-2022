    "* **Stochastic gradient descent**: A single training example is used in each iteration. The gradient (or the derivative of the cost function) is computed for that training example and it is used to update the weights.\n",
    "* **Batch gradient descent**: The entire training set is used in each iteration. The average of the gradients for all the training examples is computed and it is used to update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* The stochastic converges much faster for larger datasets than the batch gradient descent since the weights are updated a lot more frequently.\n",
    "* For batch gradient descent, the cost function declines consistently with each iteration, whereas for the stochastic gradient descent, the cost fluctuates and declines overall after each epoch.\n",
    "* The stochastic gradient descent cannot make use of the vectorized operations unlike batch gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mini-batch gradient descent** is a mix of the above two and a good compromise. The training set is divided into batches and a single batch is used in each iteration.  The batch sizes of 32, 64 and 128 are often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, mini-batch is most commonly used, especially for the large datasets. \n",

    "Our intuition tells us that the learning rate $\\alpha$ should be larger at the beginning when are weights are initialized randomly and are far from being optimal and then it can be reduced as the training process proceeds.This is called learning rate schedule or learning rate decay. The two common methods used are linear decay or exponential decay.\n",
